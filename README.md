# Machine learning
# Project 1: Credit Scoring Model

## 🎯 Objective
Develop a model to predict whether a loan applicant will default or repay the loan using financial and personal data.

## 📌 Key Highlights
Analyzed income, loan amount, interest rate, and employment length.

Applied Logistic Regression for classification.

Visualized default distribution, income comparison, and correlation heatmap.

Evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression)

# 🖊 Project 2: Handwritten Character Recognition

## 🎯 Objective
Build a model to recognize handwritten digits using pixel values from the MNIST dataset.

# 🏥 Project 3: Disease Prediction from Medical Data

## 🎯 Objective
Create a predictive model to classify patients as likely or unlikely to have a certain disease based on medical data.

## 📌 Key Highlights
Used labeled medical datasets with features like symptoms and patient history.

Applied classification techniques to predict disease likelihood.

Visualized key distributions and evaluated model performance.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn (Classification Models)

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
Experiment with Random Forest and XGBoost for better accuracy.

Apply cross-validation to improve generalization.

Add more datasets for other medical or financial prediction tasks.
